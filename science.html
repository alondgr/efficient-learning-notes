        <div class="box">
            <h2>Focus vs Diffuse mode</h2>
            <p>
                Focus mode is when we're completely focused on a task, like taking an exam. Our brains perform just one
                thing.
                This activates the prefrontal cortex. Diffuse mode is the opposite. When we daydream or let our minds
                wander,
                many different areas of the brain are activated. Exercising and sleeping are forms of diffuse mode. We
                need
                both
                modes to learn effectively. We need to alternate between these two modes. Studying a little bit every
                day is
                better than craming everthing all at once. "Dual-task interference"
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>The Science of sleep</h2>
            <p>
                When we're awake, our brains produce toxic waste products. Sleep allows brain cells to shrink,
                facilitating
                fluid flow
                and toxin clearance. This energy-intensive process requires our body to shutdown. Sleep enables our
                brain to
                reorganize.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Brain training</h2>
            <p>
                Learning forms new neural connections. Repetition strengthens these connections. Our brains are
                constantly
                evolvingâ€”either growing or deteriorating. Applying focus and diffuse modes helps us build and maintain
                these
                neural connections.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                Negative feedback is more effective than positive feedback. By getting negative feedback, we know
                exactly
                what
                to fix. positive feedback is great for the begining, it makes us feel good. As we advance and ascend to
                higher
                levels of expertise in our field, negative feedback can be instrumental in our growth and development.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Procrastination</h2>
            <p>
                When learning something new, our brains often associate it with discomfort or fear of failure. This
                emotional
                response can lead to procrastination and seeking immediate gratification through distractions like
                social
                media.

                To overcome this, it's important to recognize that the initial discomfort of learning is a temporary
                challenge.
                While social media offers short-term pleasure, investing in learning and personal growth leads to
                long-term
                rewards and fulfillment. Happiness is crucial for avoiding procrastination.

            <h2>Short and Long Term Memory </h2>
            <p>
                Short term memory AKA "working memory" our prefrontel part of our brain. Long term memory is all over
                our
                brain.
                We can usually hold 4 chunks of information when working with short term memory. Long term memory is
                created
                when the information in the short term memory is being used over and over. "Spaced Repetition"
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Active VS Passive Learning</h2>
            <p>
                We learn more by active engagement. Listening to podcast or watching youtube videos or watching other
                people
                code is passive learning. Easy and not efficient. In order for connections to form, we need to take
                action.
                Passive learning feels good. It's easy and we feel good that we are learning. You can't learn how to
                play
                basketball by just watching games and never playing. Recalling the material is better than rereading.
                Before we reread a piece of information, it's best to try to remember as much as possible in order for
                the
                dots
                to connect. The illusion of competence is when we look at a solution of a problem without trying to
                solve it
                ourselves. One hour of test is better than one hour of study.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>The science of motivation</h2>
            <p>
                There are two types of motivation: Intrinsic motivation: Comes from the inside. It fits our values and
                what
                we
                be
                belive in.
                And there's external motivation: money, salary and gifts. In order to learn we need intrinsic
                motivation.
                We need three things:
                1. Autonomy- to have control. We want to work on things that gives us control over our lives.
                2. Mastery- We are intrinsicly motivated by becoming a master in our field.
                3. Purpose- What is my purpose? what is my destiny?
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Setting big goals is exciting but also freitning. Our flight or flight mechanism is triggered when it
                senses
                large goals. We need to take small steps toward the goal. By doing that, we eliminate the fear of
                failure.
                Over
                long term, those small steps will compound. By forming small habbits and clear goals, we're more likely
                to
                accomplish our bigger goal long term. Well defiined specific goals is what we need. <br>
                SMART Goals: <br>

                <strong>A</strong>ctionable <br>
                <strong>R</strong>elevant <br>
                <strong>T</strong>ime bound <br> -->
            <ul>
                <li class="smart"><strong><em>S</em>pecific:</strong> Define the goal and make it clear and as specific
                    as
                    you
                    can. For
                    example: 1. Get
                    healthy vs 2.
                    Lose Weight vs 3. Lose 10 Pounds. The third goal is specific and will likely get better results than
                    the
                    previous two. </li>
                <li class="smart"><strong><em>M</em>easurable:</strong> We need to have a clear way to measure whether
                    the
                    goal
                    was
                    accomplished. If
                    our goal was to
                    climb the top of a mountain, it's a simple yes or no way of measurement. If our goal was to lose 10
                    punds we
                    need a scale to determine if the goal was met.</li>
                <li class="smart"><strong><em>A</em>ctionable:</strong> How will the goal be achieved? Do we have the
                    resources
                    to achieve it?
                    If the
                    actions required to achieve a goal are unclear or there are a large number of actions, we should
                    consider
                    breaking down the main goal into manageable, actionable sub-goals.
                </li>
                <li class="smart"><strong><em>R</em>elevant:</strong> A common issue we face is having too many goals at
                    the
                    same time, or
                    pursuing the
                    wrong goals. For this we can use the Pareto rule: Which are the 20% of goals that will provide me
                    with
                    80%
                    of my return?
                </li>
                <li class="smart"><strong><em>T</em>ime bound:</strong> By including a specific date by which a goal
                    should
                    be
                    accomplished,
                    it
                    helps provide incentive and allows us to monitor progress.

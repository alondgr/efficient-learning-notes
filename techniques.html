            <h2>The Pomodoro technique</h2>
            <p>
                25 minutes of focus mode (learning or working on a task) and 5 minutes off (diffuse mode). The time of
                interval
                can vary. This technique is great for killing procrastination. It's best to start with the least
                desiered
                task.

            <h2>Chunk the subject</h2>
            <p>
                Each letter in the alphabet is its own entity: A,B,C ... but when we make one chunk out of those enities
                it
                becomes an entity of its own. For example, adding the letters "c" "a" and "t" creates a word with a
                meaning.
                When we encounter the word "CAT" we don't interprit it each time by reading each letter at a time. We've
                already
                chunked these letters into the word "cat" and stored it in our long term memory. A way to chunk a
                subject is
                to
                divide and conquer. When we encounter a big problem, we need to break things down to small peices that
                we
                can
                store in our long term memory" was corrected to "A way to chunk a subject is to divide and conquer. When
                we
                encounter a big problem, we need to break things down into small pieces that we can store in our
                long-term
                memory
                "One thing you will notice is that in the above examples, they all have short lessons below 10 minutes
                (just
                like this course does). Chunking the subject is essential to learning, and some of the best ways you can
                tackle
                hard problems or chunk subjects yourself is to:

                Grab a notebook, or a one page piece of paper, and try to write down everything you have to learn into
                one
                page.
                A 1 page summary of EVERYTHING you need to learn. If that is too difficult, it means you haven't chunked
                the
                subject enough. For example, let's say you wanted to learn everything there is to know about Computer
                Science.
                How would you chunk that into a 1 page summary? Here is how one person did it:"

            <p>
                When is my focus time?
                Have I done this before? What's + 1? How caN I gain a plus one point from yesterday? Will I get
                immediate feedback? Write it down. At the end of the activity or at the end of the day, write down what
                you've accomplished.

            <h2>Create a Roadmap</h2>
            <p>
                Before we start learning a new topic, we should make a roadmap. A clear patch toward the goal. Research
                books, posts, reviews, what's relevent and what isn't. recognize quality resources. Use coggle/word
                doc/google sheet. What topic is the most importanat?

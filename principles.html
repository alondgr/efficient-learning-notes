        This section is intended for rewiring our brain. The principles section will introduce some
        truths to make us realize. Adjusting our brains to look at the world in a different way. From a place that we
        have no control over, to a place where we have control and can shape it.

            <h2>Learning VS Winning</h2>
            <p>
                In school we want to get good grades so that we pass the class, rather than actually take interest in
                what
                we're
                learning.
                Paul Graham's essay <a href="https://paulgraham.com/lesson.html" target="_blank">"The
                    Lesson to Unlearn"</a> argues that the traditional education system often prioritizes grades over
                true
                understanding. This focus on grades can lead to students prioritizing short-term memorization and
                test-taking
                strategies over developing a deep understanding of the subject matter. As a result, many students
                struggle
                to
                apply their knowledge in real-world situations. Graham suggests that to be successful, students need to
                unlearn
                this focus on grades and instead focus on developing a genuine curiosity and passion for learning. By
                doing
                so,
                students will be better equipped to solve problems, think critically, and innovate.

            <h2>What does success mean to you?</h2>
            <p>
                Does success mean being smart? Every person needs to understand what succes means to them. Being
                wealthy?
                Being
                happy? <strong>Drive</strong> and <strong>persistence</strong> can lead to success. In order to succeed
                you
                will
                need to take risks and mistakes.

            <h2>The Obstacle</h2>
            <p>
                As we learn and make progress we will encounter every now and then the feeling that we "suck". We can
                feel
                the
                distance from where we are right now and where we want to be. Sometimes it seems like we'll never get
                there. Change "you suck" to "good, I'm doing something worthwhile". If you succeed right away without
                making mistakes, that means you're not learning.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Compund Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of learning in a marathon for 8 hours straight and then not learning for a week. Learn 20
                minutes
                everyday. presistence is the key. we're in this for the long run. <br>
                "Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good" -Alan Weiss, Ph.D. <br>

        <div class="box light">
            <h2>Failues don't count</h2>
            <p>
                Nobody cares about your past failures. You can apply to 100 jobs and get rejected. On the 101st time,
                you
                can
                get
                accpeted, all these previous times won't matter. Your mistakes don't count against you. The more
                failures we
                encounter, the more feedback we will have to in order to improve.

            <h2>Choice VS Chore and Reframing</h2>
            <p>
                If every time you study and learn, you approach it as a chore, long term, you're likely going to quit.
                Washing
                the dishes is a chore.
                Chores are temporary. Learning is a choice. We can reframe the concept of learning and look at it in a
                fresh
                new
                perspective. Instead of saying "I'm not good enough" say "I'm not there yet". Shift your perspective to
                what
                you
                can control instead of what you can't.

            <h2>The Pareto Principle</h2>
            <p>
                The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, states that a significant portion of results come
                from a
                small percentage of inputs. Roughly 80% of the results usually come from 20% of the causes.
                Eliminating
                something to its essence. What is the 20%
                that's going to get me 80% of the results?

            <h2>Skill Stacking</h2>
            <p>
                Curiosity, value learning, gathering skills. Instead of getting good at one thing, get good at multiple
                things.
                By combining these skills you can create a little nische. Have skills that work well together but also
                unique.

            <h2>Happiness Factors</h2>
            <p>
                If you are not happy, it will be very difficult to learn. If you are in a negative mood, you're at a
                disadvantage and won't learn efficiently ot at all. Write down 5-7 key things that make you happy.
                Making music, working out, watching movies, etc. By being happy, you will stick to the progress,
                maintain and improve. try to monitor and check up on them every few months.
